 ## Interactive Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomised Trial Data Analysis Tool

#### Enhance scientific reproducibility
This Shiny app is designed to replicate the results of a Stepped-Wedge Pragmatic Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial conducted to improve the quality of antenatal care in Mozambique.

The trial, published in The Lancet Global Health, evaluated the impact of providing medical supply kits to antenatal care clinics.

This app allows users to explore the trial data interactively through a pivot table widget, enabling them to analyze outcome measures such as blood pressure, proteinuria, and syphilis testing rates without requiring advanced statistical or programming skills.

The app was developed to enhance scientific reproducibility by making the trial data accessible and analyzable for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

The source code for this R Shiny app and the dataset are available for download within the app.
